# The Property Puzzle

**65% Stress (IDIS Viitorul)**  
Fragmented Data

<!-- bg:![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-maze) -->

<!--
(L): "Buying or selling property in Moldova... it can often feel like navigating a complex maze in the dark. In fact, research, like that from IDIS Viitorul, suggests around 65% of Moldovans find this process highly stressful and opaque. Why? Fragmented information, difficulty assessing fair value, and a general lack of transparent, forward-looking insights."

# Our Iterative Discovery

Hypothesis → Validation → Pivot → Core Problem

<!-- bg:![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-lightbulb-path) -->

<!--
(L): "We didn't arrive at our solution by chance. Our journey was iterative. We started with broad ideas, formulated hypotheses – like a premium tool for agents, or a basic listing aggregator. We (simulated) validated these, learned from what didn't quite hit the mark for the broader public need, and pivoted. This rigorous process led us to the specific, core problem we are here to solve: empowering everyday Moldovans."

# Moldova Insight Realty (MVP)

**Clarity. Prediction. Empowerment.**

<!-- bg:![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-dashboard-mockup) -->

<!--
(A): "And that core problem led us to Moldova Insight Realty. We're presenting our Minimum Viable Product: a non-profit platform architected to bring clarity, predictive insights, and empowerment to the Moldovan real estate market, starting with Chișinău."

For 'Ion & Maria Stratan,' a family needing neighborhood safety, school info, and 3-5 year price stability predictions. Our MVP is tailored to these critical needs, aiming to make their journey less stressful and more informed."
-->

# The Architectural Blueprint

React Frontend  
C Backend Core  
PostgreSQL DB  
RESTful API

<!-- bg:![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-architecture-diagram) -->

<!--
(L): "Our tech stack is designed for efficiency and scalability. The frontend is built with React, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user experience. The core backend is written in C, chosen for its performance and control over system resources. We use PostgreSQL for our database, providing robust data management capabilities. All these components communicate through a RESTful API, ensuring seamless integration and interaction."
-->

# The Power of C

C for Backend: Efficiency  
Scalability  
Resource Control  
libmicrohttpd, libpq

```c
// Example: Aggregating property data
struct Property {
  int id;
  double price;
  char district[32];
};
```

<!--
(L): "Why C for the backend? It's all about efficiency and control. C allows us to manage resources meticulously, ensuring our application can scale effectively. We leverage libraries like libmicrohttpd for HTTP services and libpq for PostgreSQL interactions, making our backend both powerful and efficient."

# DSA in Action

Algorithms: Time Series (Prophet)  
Regression  
Spatial Indexing  
Efficient Data Structures

<!-- bg:![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-dsa-icons) -->

<!--
(A): "Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are at the heart of our predictive capabilities. We use time series analysis with Prophet for forecasting, regression models for trend analysis, and spatial indexing for efficient geographic data handling. These advanced techniques enable us to provide accurate and actionable insights to our users."
