# Moldova Insight Realty MVP - Demo Script

## Introduction (1 minute)
- **What**: "Moldova Insight Realty is a platform for transparent real estate data analytics in Chișinău, designed to help potential buyers, sellers, and investors make informed decisions based on historical data and predictive insights."
- **Why**: "The real estate market in Moldova lacks transparency. Buyers often struggle to know if they're paying a fair price, and there's no easy way to understand market trends. Our platform addresses these pain points."
- **Tech Stack**: "We've built this with a React frontend for a modern user experience, along with a C backend and PostgreSQL database structure to fulfill the course requirements and ensure high performance."

## Demo Walkthrough (5 minutes)

### 1. Home Page (30 seconds)
- "Our home page presents a clean, modern interface built with Tailwind CSS. Notice the responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile."
- "Here we highlight the platform's key value propositions: transparency, data-driven insights, and neighborhood analysis."
- "These district cards provide quick access to property information in the most popular areas of Chișinău - Botanica, Buiucani, Centru, etc."

### 2. Properties Listing (1 minute)
- "Let me show you our property listing page. Each property card displays the essential information: price, location, rooms, and size."
- **Demo the filters**: "Users can filter properties by district, price range, number of rooms, and more. Let's try filtering for 2-room apartments in Botanica under €70,000."
- "Notice how the UI updates dynamically as we apply filters, providing immediate feedback."
- "The responsive design ensures a good experience on mobile devices as well - let me demonstrate how the layout adapts."

### 3. Property Details (1 minute)
- "When a user clicks on a property, they see this detailed view with comprehensive information."
- "We highlight key features such as the address, price per square meter, and amenities."
- "The 'Save Property' button allows logged-in users to save properties to their dashboard. If a user isn't logged in, they're redirected to the login page."
- "We've also included contact options so users can inquire about properties they're interested in."

### 4. Trends & Predictions (1 minute)
- "This is one of our core features - historical price trends and future predictions visualized with the Recharts library."
- **Demo the chart**: "Users can select different districts and property types to view specialized trends. For example, let's look at 2-room apartments in Centru."
- "The chart shows average price per square meter over time, making it easy to identify seasonal patterns and long-term trends."
- "Below the chart, we display 6-month and 12-month price predictions based on our algorithm. In a full implementation, this would use a regression model implemented in C."

### 5. User Features (1 minute)
- "Now let me demonstrate the user authentication features. We have simple, user-friendly login and registration forms."
- **Log in with credentials**: "Let's log in with our demo account: demo@example.com / password123."
- "Once logged in, users access their dashboard where they can view saved properties and saved searches."
- "For the MVP, we're using local storage to persist this data, but in the full implementation, this would be stored in our PostgreSQL database."

## Technical Implementation (1.5 minutes)
- **Frontend**: "The frontend is built with React and Vite for fast development and optimal performance. We've used Tailwind CSS for styling, which allowed us to create a polished UI very quickly."
- **API & Data Layer**: "We've implemented a mock API service that simulates backend interactions with realistic delays and responses. This allowed us to build and test the frontend independently."
- **C Backend Structure**: "Let me quickly show you the C backend structure we've prepared. We have header files defining the API contracts and stub implementation files that would be fully implemented in phase 2."
- **Database Schema**: "We've designed a PostgreSQL schema with tables for users, properties, districts, and saved searches, which you can see in our SQL files."

## Code Quality & Architecture (30 seconds)
- "We've followed best practices in our code organization, with a clear separation of concerns."
- "Components are modular and reusable, following the React component model."
- "We've implemented proper error handling and loading states throughout the application."
- "The codebase is structured to make the future implementation of the C backend straightforward."

## Next Steps & Full Implementation (1 minute)
- "For the full implementation, we would develop the C backend using libmicrohttpd for the HTTP server and libpq for PostgreSQL database access."
- "We would implement the prediction algorithm in C, starting with a simple linear regression model that could be enhanced over time."
- "We would connect the React frontend to the live C backend API endpoints instead of using mocked data."
- "Finally, we would deploy the application to a production environment with proper CI/CD pipelines."

## Q&A (1 minute)
- "I'm happy to answer any questions about our implementation choices, the architecture, or future plans for the platform."
